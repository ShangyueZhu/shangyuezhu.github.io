            <h3><b>Research Description</b></h3>
            <p>This research is a spin-off of short video research, 
                which aims to generate a ranked list from a few hundred candidate videos for personalized recommendations. 
            
            <!-- The problem of the research can be simplified to find the data that possesses 
            the characteristic amount of jumping in a string of time sequence data.
            The purpose of this research is to extract the motion information when jumping, such as jumping
            up and down. 
            The data comes from a specific muscle sensor, which records muscle stretch during
            jumping. Through Recurrent Neural Network modeling, the movement characteristics of the jump
            are separated, and extracted the jump information to recognize the specific activities.  </p> -->

                <li>Data. The website log data records the browsing time of the user, clicks on the link,
                     and the source content of the webpage contains video metadata such as duration and bit rate. </li>
