				<h3><b>Short Video wastage. (In processing)  </b></h3>
				<p>
					University of Notre Dame | 2022
				</p>
				<p>
					The project aims to understand the causes of short video data wastage in terms of viewing time and buffering.
                    Analyzed the reasons for the waste of different short video servers at the pre-load level.
                    Designed an algorithm to reduce the short video wastage from pre-loading and buffer level.

				<h3><b>Measurement Study across Short Video Services  </b></h3>
				<p>
					University of Notre Dame & AT&T Labs Research | 2021 - 2022
				</p>
				<p>
					Short videos have emerged recently as a popular form of short-duration User Generated Content
(UGC) within modern social media. <a href="/Images/ShortVideos/Shortvideo_poster_0225.pdf">This work</a> provided a comprehensive comparison of four popular
short video services. In particular, the work focuses on exploring content characteristics and evaluating
the video quality across resolutions for each service. By conducting an experimental study, the work
investigates data consumption and finally evaluates achieved QoE under different network scenarios
and application configurations. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3524273.3528186">Read more</a>

				<!-- <h3><b>TikTok Characteristics.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					University of Notre Dame | 2020 - 2021
				</p>
				<p>
					This research target to understand the characteristics of the short video streams in particular on
TikTok platform. This research presents the principle of preload mechanism in TikTok app contains
the preload video number and size. In addition, combining the above TikTok users data, this
research built a Markov chain model to emulate TikTok user behaviors. By emulating user behavior
and constructing TikTok download mode, this research provides the evaluation results of data
consumption during watching TikTok videos.

				<h3><b>Congestion Prediction in WiFi Video Streaming.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					University of Notre Dame | 2019 - 2020
				</p>
				<p>
					This research aims to detect the network changes to deliver a better rate adaptation mechanism for
adaptive video streaming. This research proposes an algorithm, Congestion Prediction-DASH (CP-
DASH), which is designed to prevent stalling and maximize video quality. The CP-DASH algorithm
leverages the aggregate MAC protocol data unit information provided by Block Acknowledgement
aggregate control packets to allow a WiFi device to passively predict link congestion.

				<h3><b>Jumping Motion Recognition.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					Figur8. Inc | Feb - Jul 2018
				</p>
				<p>
					The purpose of this research is to extract the motion features, such as jumping
up and down. The data comes from a specific muscle sensor, which records muscle stretch during
jumping. Through Recurrent Neural Network modeling, the movement characteristics of the jump
are separated, and extracted the jumping features to recognize the specific activities.

				<h3><b>Activities Recognition in Smart home.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					Ball State Univeristy | 2017
				</p>
				<p>
					The research proposed a signals solution, Activities Recognition based on Signal Filter (ARSF), 
					to recognize human activities through commodity off-the-shelf radar sensors.
					The radar sensors detect abnormal and instantaneous motion situations by high-frequency radio signal. 
					The research purpose is to recognize the specific activities of residents in smart homes. 
					During this project, I designed a motion separation algorithm, which extracts the corresponding motion data from the whole data background.
					Developed an activity recognition system based on distinct features, 
					which distinguishes the distinct motions. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8422107">Read more</a>

				<h3><b>User Localization based on Ultrasonic Beamforming.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					Ball State Univeristy | 2016 - 2017
				</p>
				<p>
					This <a href="/Images/BSU/Poster_shangyue.pdf">research</a> work designs and develops a noninvasive distance-based user localization and tracking
solution, DiLT, for smart systems. DiLT consists of a mechanical ultrasonic beam-forming design
for omni-space sensing, a contrastive divergence learning to localize a user and a binary back-off 
algorithm to track the motion of the user. During this project, I designed an ultrasonic
scanning platform to track the users' location. Developed a location tracking algorithm to filter
the environment and noise to identify the specific users' location. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8390385">Read more</a>
