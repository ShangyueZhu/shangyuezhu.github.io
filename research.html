				<h3><b>Measurement Study across Short Video Services  </b></h3>
				<p>
					University of Notre Dame | 2021 - 2022
				</p>
				<p>
					Short videos have emerged recently as a popular form of short-duration User Generated Content
(UGC) within modern social media. This work provided a comprehensive comparison of four popular
short video services. In particular, the work focus on exploring content characteristics and evaluate
the video quality across resolutions for each service. With conduct an experimental study, the work
investigate data consumption and finally evaluate achieved QoE under different network scenarios
and application configurations. <a href="/Researches/ShortVideo.html">Read more</a>

				<!-- <h3><b>TikTok Characteristics.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					University of Notre Dame | 2020 - 2021
				</p>
				<p>
					This research target to understand the characteristics of the short video streams in particular on
TikTok platform. This research presents the principle of preload mechanism in TikTok app contains
the preload video number and size. In addition, combining the above TikTok users data, this
research built a Markov chain model to emulate TikTok user behaviors. By emulating user behavior
and constructing TikTok download mode, this research provides the evaluation results of data
consumption during watching TikTok videos.

				<h3><b>Congestion Prediction in WiFi Video Streaming.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					University of Notre Dame | 2019 - 2020
				</p>
				<p>
					This research aims to detect the network changes to deliver a better rate adaptation mechanism for
adaptive video streaming. This research proposes an algorithm, Congestion Prediction-DASH (CP-
DASH), which is designed to prevent stalling and to maximize video quality. The CP-DASH algorithm
leverages the aggregate MAC protocol data unit information provided by Block Acknowledgement
aggregate control packets to allow a WiFi device to passively predict link congestion.

				<h3><b>Jump Activities Recognition.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					Figur8. Inc | Feb - Jul 2018
				</p>
				<p>
					The purpose of this research is to extract the motion information when jumping, such as jumping
up and down. The data comes from a specific muscle sensor, which records muscle stretch during
jumping. Through Recurrent Neural Network modeling, the movement characteristics of the jump
are separated, and extracted the jump information to recognize the specific activities.

				<h3><b>Activities Recognition in Smart home.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					Ball State Univeristy | 2017
				</p>
				<p>
					The research proposed a signals solution, Activities Recognition based on Signal Filter (ARSF), to
recognize the human activates through commodity off-the-shelf radar sensors. The radar sensors
detect abnormal and instantaneous motion situations by high frequency radio signal. The research
purpose is to recognize the specific activities of residents in smart homes. During this project, I
designed a motion separation algorithm, which extract the corresponding motion data from the
whole data background. Developed an activity recognition system based on the distinct features,
which distinguishes the distinct motions. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8422107">Read more</a>

				<h3><b>User Localization based on Ultrasonic Beamforming.  </b></h3>
				<p>
					Ball State Univeristy | 2016 - 2017
				</p>
				<p>
					This research work designs and develops a noninvasive distance based user localization and tracking
solution, DiLT, for smart systems. DiLT consists of a mechanical ultrasonic beam-forming design
for omni-space sensing, a contrastive divergence learning to localize a user and a binary back-
off algorithm to track the motion of the user. During this project, I designed an ultrasonic
scanning platform to track the users location. Developed a location tracking algorithm to filter
the environment and noise to identify the specific users location. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8390385">Read more</a>
