          <h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>
          <p><b>Measurement Study across Short Video Services. </b> (2021)</p>
          <p>This work provided a comprehensive comparison of four popular
            short video services. In particular, the work focus on exploring content characteristics and evaluating
            the video quality across resolutions for each service.</p>
           <br>
          <p><b>Congestion Prediction in WiFi Video Streaming.</b> (2020)</p>
          <p>This research aims to detect the network changes to deliver a better rate adaptation mechanism for
            adaptive video streaming. This research proposes an algorithm, Congestion Prediction-DASH (CP-
            DASH), which is designed to prevent stalling and maximize video quality.
            </p>
           <br>
          <p><b>Jump Activities Recognition.</b> (2018)</p>
          <p>The purpose of this research is to extract the motion information when jumping, such as jumping
            up and down. Through Recurrent Neural Network modeling (RNN), the movement characteristics of the jump
            are separated, and extracted the jump information to recognize the specific activities.
            </p>
           <br>
          <p><b>Activity Recognition based on radar (Walabot) sensor.</b> (2017)</p>
          <p>The research proposes an ambient radar sensor-based solution to recognize the activities 
            that humans normally perform in indoor environments. 
            The radar sensors detect abnormal and instantaneous motion situations by high-frequency radio signal. 
           </p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Tracing location based on Ultrasonic sensor.</b> (2016)</p>
          <p>This research work designs and develops a noninvasive distance-based user localization and tracking solution, DiLT, for smart systems.
             DiLT consists of mechanical ultrasonic beam-forming designs to track the motion of the user. </p>
      

          <!-- <b>Logistic Regression classifier for Motion Recognition (Signal Spectrum) Walabot Sensor</b>
          <p>This is a series of activity recognition for classify distinct intensity motions 
            (raw data obtained as radio signal data) based on logistic regression machine learning algorithm.</p> -->
          <!-- <b>Activity Recognition based on radar (Walabot) sensor!</b>
          <p>The research proposes an ambient radar sensor based a solution to recognize the activities 
            that humans normally perform in indoor environments. 
            Activity recognition through radio waves is the process of identifying an activity during a normal daily life. 
            The radar sensors detect abnormal and instantaneous motion situations by high frequency radio signal. 
            The research purpose is recognizing the specific activities of residents in the smart home.</p>
          <b>Tracing location based on Ultrasonic sensor !</b>
          <p>This research work designs and develops a noninvasive distance based user localization and tracking solution,
          DiLT, for smart systems. DiLT consists of a mechanical ultrasonic beam-forming design for omni-space sensing, 
          a contrastive divergence learning to localize a user and a binary back-off algorithm to track the motion of the user. 
          The research purpose is tracing the residents location in the smart home.</p> -->
          <!-- <b>Sequence-Based Software Specification</b>
          <p>This research based on the software engineer development, 
          which is a rigorous software specification method. 
          This research focus on converting informal statements of functional requirements to precise software specifications. 
          The purpose is to develop a formal system model for code development and testing.</p> -->
