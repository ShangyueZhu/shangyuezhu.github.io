          <p>The research proposes an ambient radar sensor based a solution to recognize the activities 
            that humans normally perform in indoor environments. 
            Activity recognition through radio waves is the process of identifying an activity during a normal daily life. 
            The radar sensors detect abnormal and instantaneous motion situations by high frequency radio signal. 
            The research purpose is recognizing the specific activities of residents in the smart home.</p>
